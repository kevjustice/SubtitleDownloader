This was a fun little project that saves me a few click in Kodi.  It goes through a library of video files recursively and searches subdl.com for any subtitles.  It downloads them, extracts them, renames them to the same name as the video file, and cleans up after itself.

Why did I do this?  Yes, it's a timesaver...but...  I wanted to see how well I could use Aider and other AI tools to help me do this.  Some of the code it came up with was much more robust than I would have.  It was a neat experiment!
